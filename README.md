# Lost and Found System

The **Lost and Found System** is a web application designed to help users easily submit, search, and claim lost items. Whether you’ve misplaced an item or found something, this platform allows seamless interaction for submitting and managing lost and found items.

This repository contains the **backend API** of the application, which is built using Django and structured for scalability, security, and ease of use.

## System Architecture

The system is designed with modularity in mind, with a clear separation between the user management, items, and claims functionality. Each component interacts with the others to ensure smooth data flow and interactions.

## Data Models

The core data models for the system include Users, Items, and Claims. These models ensure that the platform is capable of storing and retrieving the necessary information for lost and found processes.

-   **User Model:** Handles user registration, authentication, and roles.
-   **Item Model:** Stores details of lost and found items.
-   **Claim Model:** Manages the process of users claiming found items.
